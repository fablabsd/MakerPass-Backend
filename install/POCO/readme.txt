Unzip / untar the poco zip
view the README in there, with easy instructions for building on linux
On the Pi I was able to use just make, not gmake
Also, read toward the bottom of the linux install instructions where it gives you options 
to not make the samples if you don't want.  Those take a long time i.e. hours and hours
